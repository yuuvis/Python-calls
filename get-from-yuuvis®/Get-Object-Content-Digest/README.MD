## Validate content digest by ID

For already imported documents, using the [Store one or more documents](https://yuuvis.io/docs/services/yuuvis-api/operations/ObjectsPost?) endpoint, a content digest is automatically generated and stored [(Secure Hash Algorythm, SHA256)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234)

To validate the content digest for a stored document, you use the **"Validate content digest by ID"** endpoint. Send a request with the objectId which generates a new content digest based on the currently stored document. This newly generated content digest is compared with the formerly generated and stored one.
